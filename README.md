# Applied-Data-Science-with-Python-Coursera

This repository contains the assignments that I completed while completing the "Applied Data Science with Python" designed by University of Michigan on Coursera. The course is a bigger collection of 5 individual courses, each focusing on different aspects of Data Science, with a hands on approach of teaching different python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit learn and so on. The following are the courses I have completed, or am in the process of completing.

1. Introduction to Data Science in Python (Pandas, NumPy)
2. Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
